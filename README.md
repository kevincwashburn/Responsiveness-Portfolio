# Responsiveness-Portfolio

This portfolio site is comprised of three pages. "About Me" gives a brief background on why I want to pursue web development and shows a photograph of myself. "Portfolio" currently displays placeholder images and text and will be updated as projects are completed. Finally, "Contact" shows a form that will allow a viewer to contact me directly via email. 

In addition to the content summarized above, the site's layout is responsive based on the screen size of the device a viewer may be using.
